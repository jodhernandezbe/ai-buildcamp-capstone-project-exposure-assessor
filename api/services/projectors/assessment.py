"""Projector of the batch assessment: every facility's chain, filed like the single tools'.

The artifact holds the assessed facilities (fully, or at their own-stack worst case only) and
the screened-out ones with their screening value; an earlier form was the list of assessed
facilities alone, and is still read. A facility the batch did not assess travels with its
reason; it never replaces a real result for the same facility.
