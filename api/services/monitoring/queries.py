"""The SQL the Monitoring view sends to Logfire, built from the ``[telemetry]`` settings.

Logfire's query API has no bind parameters, so a value only ever enters a statement as a quoted
literal: a name from configuration, or a session id that matched ``THREAD_ID_PATTERN`` (the
rule every thread id already follows). That is why bandit's B608 is silenced on the statements
below: nothing else is ever interpolated into them. The result columns the parsers read are the
aliases used here: ``trace_id``, ``start_timestamp``, ``duration`` (seconds), ``sid``, ``question``,
``model``, ``outcome``, ``input_tokens``, ``cached_input_tokens``, ``output_tokens``,
``cost_usd``, ``cost_status``, ``model_calls``, ``tool_calls`` for the sessions listing, and
``span_name``, ``op``, ``tool``, ``usage``, ``status``, ``is_exception`` for the detail.
