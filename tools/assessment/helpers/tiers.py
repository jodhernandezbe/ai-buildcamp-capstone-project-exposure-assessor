"""Which facilities go on at each tier: screened out on a bound, refined, then fully assessed.

A facility is left out only when its screening value is below both thresholds; facilities
that go on are ordered by how far they exceed a threshold, not by how much they emit. Without
any benchmark nothing can be screened out, and the order is the emission rate. Every facility
that reaches a threshold is refined; ``max_refined`` is only a safety bound, and what it
leaves over is reported.
