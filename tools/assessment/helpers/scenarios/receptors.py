"""Rank the census tracts around a facility by what a scenario's own configuration gives there.

The scenario fixes the weather (stability class and 10 m wind speed), the stack and the emission
rate; the concentration is then evaluated at each tract's distance with the same equations as
the worst-case search, so a tract at the distance of the maximum has the maximum. Bearing is
reported but does not select: the screening weather has no wind direction.
