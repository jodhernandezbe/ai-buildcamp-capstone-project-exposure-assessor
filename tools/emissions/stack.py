def fetch_stack_parameters_from_nei(frs_id: str | int) -> NeiStackResult:
    """Fetch a facility's own stacks (height, diameter, exit velocity and temperature) from the NEI.

    Purpose:
        Plume rise and dispersion depend on stack geometry. This is the first choice for
        stack parameters: call it after identifying a facility. A facility usually has
        several stacks, so it returns several distinct CANDIDATE stacks (real records,
        never averaged), lowest stack first, at most a configured number. Evaluate the
        exposure for EVERY candidate and report the range of results rather than picking
        one. If `candidates` is empty (the facility has no NEI stack data), call
        `fetch_stack_parameters_from_scc` instead.

    Args:
        frs_id: EPA Facility Registry Service identifier of the facility (12 digits, as
            returned by `query_emissions_inventory`); a number is also accepted.

    Returns:
        A dict with:
        - eis_ids: NEI (EIS) facility IDs found for the FRS ID
        - candidates: list of dicts, each with stack_height (m above ground),
          stack_diameter (m), exit_velocity (m/s), exit_temperature (K), source "NEI" and
          scc null; empty if the NEI has nothing usable
        - total_candidates: distinct combinations found before the cap
        - warnings: why candidates are missing, or what was merged or left out

def fetch_stack_parameters_from_scc(scc_code: str | int | None = None) -> StackParameters:

    Purpose:
        Use this ONLY after `fetch_stack_parameters_from_nei` returned no values (all four
        null) for the facility. The values are EPA PSTK (Point Source Stack Replacements)
        defaults for the kind of process identified by the SCC, not measurements of the
        facility's own stack. If no SCC is given, or the SCC is unknown or invalid, the EPA
        AirToxScreen global point-source default is returned instead (3.0 m height, 0.2 m
        diameter, 4.0 m/s, 295.4 K), so a result always has values. Get the SCC from
        `lookup_scc_process_description`; if it gives none, call this tool without
        `scc_code` to get the global default.

    Args:
        scc_code: Source Classification Code, digits only, e.g. "30600101", exactly as
            returned by `lookup_scc_process_description` (a number is also accepted). Omit it
            (or pass null) when the facility's SCC is not known.

    Returns:
        A dict with:
        - stack_height: m above ground
        - stack_diameter: m
        - exit_velocity: m/s
        - exit_temperature: K
        - source: "PSTK" (SCC-specific default) or "AirToxScreen global default" (generic
          fallback; state this to the user, as it is the least specific estimate)
        - scc: the SCC whose PSTK row was used, or null for the global default
