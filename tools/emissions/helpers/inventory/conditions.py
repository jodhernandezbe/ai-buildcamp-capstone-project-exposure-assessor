"""TSCA conditions of use and life cycle stages of a facility, from its TRI activities.

A TRI submission says which Section 3 activities the facility does with the chemical (produce,
import, process as a reactant, ...). The EPA crosswalk maps each activity to a TSCA life cycle
stage and condition-of-use category. Only the crosswalk rows of the configured level without a
TRI sub-use code are used, joined on the Form R section ("3.2b"). Nothing is guessed: an
activity the crosswalk lacks is dropped with a warning, and an empty result says why.
