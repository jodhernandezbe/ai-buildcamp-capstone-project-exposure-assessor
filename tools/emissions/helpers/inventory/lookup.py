    Args:
        cas: Hyphenated CAS registry number, already validated.
        tri: TRI settings (media to keep, column names).
        emissions: Emission-rate assumptions.
        aliases: Source unit spelling -> Pint-parsable unit string.
        fetcher: Source of TRI rows (injected).
        current_year: The current calendar year; only the last ``tri.recent_years`` reporting
            years ending with it are used.
        locate: Gives the coordinates of many facilities from their FRS IDs in one call
            (injected); used only for facilities whose TRI rows have none. Without it such
            facilities are omitted.
        hours_for: Gives a facility's operating hours from its NAICS code (injected); without it
            every facility gets the default hours of ``emissions``.
        conditions: Maps a facility's TRI activities to TSCA conditions of use (injected); it also
            names the activity columns to read. Without it records carry no conditions.

    Returns:
        One record per (medium, facility) of the configured media, each with its facility's
        fugitive air release; empty if nothing was reported. Data problems and a
        hit page cap are logged as warnings.

    Raises:
        TriReadError: If retrieval failed. A partial result is never returned as if it were
            complete, and a failure is never reported as "nothing reported".
