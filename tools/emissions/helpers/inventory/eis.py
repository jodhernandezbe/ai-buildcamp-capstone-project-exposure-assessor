"""Give the listed facilities their EIS (NEI) facility IDs, many per request.

The NEI's facility key is the EIS ID, registered in FRS under the facility's FRS ID. FRS also
holds the same site under more than one FRS ID at times, and TRI's ID is not always the one
with the EIS registration. A facility whose own ID has none is matched to another FRS record
of exactly the same site name in the same state within a short distance, and only when exactly
one such record has EIS registrations; anything less certain leaves the facility without an
EIS ID and says why.
