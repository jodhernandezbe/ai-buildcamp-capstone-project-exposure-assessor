"""Fold the fugitive air releases into the stack records of the same facilities.

Fugitive air evaporates inside or beside the plant and mainly exposes its workers. It is read in
its own query, but it is not a stack source: it never becomes a facility of its own and never
enters a stack emission rate. Its release is converted to kg/yr and put on the facility's record.
