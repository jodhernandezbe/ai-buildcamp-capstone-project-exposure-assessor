    """List facilities that reported emitting a chemical, with their latest reported release.

    Purpose:
        Use this to discover emission sources of a chemical from the EPA Toxics Release
        Inventory (TRI). For each facility it uses the most recent year the facility
        reported, so different facilities may be reported for different years. Only
        stack (point-source) air releases are returned; fugitive air, water and land
        releases are not. Each result carries the facility's location (latitude, longitude,
        address) and its `frs_id` identifies it. A widely reported chemical
        can take a while because TRI is read in many pages (facilities without TRI coordinates
        are then located in FRS, many per request) and may have over a thousand facilities.
        Only the largest are listed to you, highest `emission_rate` first, so the first
        facilities listed are the largest sources; `total_found`, `matching` and `note` say how
        many more there are. Never present a list as complete when `note` says it is partial.
        To look at a place, call again with `state` and/or `city`: the largest facilities there
        are listed. The listing is a view of the largest sources, not the set to assess: a
        small emitter can matter as much as a large one, and every facility found (listed or
        not) stays available to the assessment. TRI gives
        each facility's primary NAICS code and this tool adds its title in words
        (`naics_title`), nothing about its process; a process is only a candidate derived from
        the industry.
        Zero facilities means no stack air release was found for this CAS number (and place) in
        TRI, which is not evidence that nobody emits it: TRI covers only facilities above its
        reporting thresholds.
        A chemical TRI reports only as a member of a category (see `find_tri_read_across_surrogate`,
        `query_categories`) has its releases under the category code, e.g. "N420": pass that code
        as `cas_number`. Those releases are for the whole category, every member together, never
        for one chemical; the `note` says so, and you must say so too.

    Args:
        cas_number: CAS registry number as the user gave it, e.g. "50-00-0" (hyphens
            optional), or a TRI category code such as "N420" (only one reported by the
            read-across result). Never a number recalled from a chemical's name: if the user
            gave only a name, ask for the CAS number instead of calling this tool.
        state: Optional. Keep only facilities in this state, as its two-letter postal
            abbreviation, e.g. "TX".
        city: Optional. Keep only facilities in this city, by its exact name, e.g. "Houston"
            (a metropolitan area spans several city names; use `state` for a wider look).

    Returns:
        A dict with:
        - total_found: facilities found for this chemical, before `state` and `city`
        - matching: facilities that match `state` and `city` (all of them when none is given)
        - shown: facilities listed in `facilities`
        - note: says that the list is partial and how to see others; null when it is complete
        - facilities: the largest matching facilities, highest `emission_rate` first (empty if
          none, if the CAS number is invalid, or if TRI could not be read), each with:
          - frs_id: EPA Facility Registry Service identifier
          - facility_name: facility display name (may be null)
          - environmental_medium: TRI release medium, e.g. "AIR STACK"
          - reporting_year: latest year the facility reported for that medium (only the last 2
            reporting years are searched, so a facility that stopped reporting earlier is
            absent)
          - doc_ctrl_num: TRI control number of that year's submission (null if TRI gave
            none); `fetch_facility_industry` takes it
          - naics_code: primary NAICS code of that submission, digits only (null if TRI gave
            none)
          - eis_ids: the facility's NEI (EIS) facility IDs, looked up for the facilities
            listed; pass them to `fetch_stack_parameters_from_nei` so it needs no lookup of
            its own. Empty when FRS registers no EIS facility for it: then `eis_note` says
            why, and the NEI has no stack for the facility (go to the SCC-based stack)
          - eis_note: null, or why `eis_ids` is empty, or that the IDs are those of another
            FRS record of the same site (TRI's FRS ID had no EIS registration): report that
            with the stacks
          - naics_subsector, naics_subsector_title: the first three digits of the NAICS code and
            that subsector's title (e.g. 325, Chemical Manufacturing), null when the code has
            fewer than three digits; what facilities are grouped by in the dashboard
          - naics_title: that code's title in words, from the Census code lists (null when
            the code is missing or not a six-digit code of a listed vintage); this is what the
            SCC process search needs. Only when it is null is `fetch_facility_industry`
            worth calling: it asks TRI's own reference table and says whether the facility
            reported the code or EPA assigned it
          - total_release: quantity released in that year, in `unit` per year, as reported
          - unit: unit of `total_release` as reported by TRI, e.g. "Pounds"
          - emission_rate: average emission rate, g/s, assuming the facility operates
            `operating_hours_per_year`
          - operating_hours_per_year: hours per year assumed for `emission_rate`: the
            industry's average plant hours from the Census plant capacity survey when the
            facility's NAICS code (or a shorter prefix of it) is in that survey, otherwise
            8760 (continuous operation, a conservative screening assumption)
          - operating_hours_source: says which of the two it is, and for a survey figure the
            release, the survey's NAICS code and its plant hours per week
          - conditions_of_use: the TSCA conditions of use implied by what the facility told TRI
            it does with the chemical (produces, imports, uses it as a reactant, in a
            formulation, in articles, as a processing aid, ...). A facility can have several; each
            has `tri_activity`, `tri_section` (Form R Section 3 item), `lifecycle_stage`,
            `cou_category` and `mapping_strength` (a "None (CDR exempt)" strength, for an
            impurity, is not a condition of use in the CDR sense)
          - lifecycle_stages: the distinct TSCA life cycle stages of `conditions_of_use`
          - conditions_note: why `conditions_of_use` is empty (null when it is not); an empty list
            with a note means "unknown" or "none reported", not "no use"
          - latitude, longitude: decimal degrees (negative longitude is west); from TRI, or
            from the facility's FRS record when TRI has none
          - address, city, county, state, zip_code: facility location (each may be null)
