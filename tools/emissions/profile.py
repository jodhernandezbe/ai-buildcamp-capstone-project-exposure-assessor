"""Operational profile of a facility: schedule, life cycle stage, condition of use, CDR sector.

A plain function of an inventory record, not a tool the model calls: the batch assessment
composes it with the exposure results (it may use a tool folder's public modules, not its
helpers). The logic is in ``helpers/inventory/profile.py``; this supplies the shipped settings.
