"""Occupational exposure limits from a PUG View record, as numbers in mg/m^3.

Only a clear value is used: a named entry (``PEL-TWA``) holding one number and one unit, or a
free-text entry that one of the configured patterns reads. A value in ppm needs the molecular
weight; without it the value is refused, never converted with a guess. Several clear values
for one limit are used (their median) only if they agree.
