) -> ReadAcrossMatch:
    """Find the TRI chemical most similar in structure to a chemical (read-across surrogate).

    Purpose:
        Applies only to a chemical already identified by a CAS number the user gave; it never
        identifies a chemical from its name. Use it when that chemical is not on the TRI list or
        has no inhalation benchmark: it names the most similar TRI chemical, whose data may stand
        in for it (read-across), chosen by structural similarity.

        How to read the result:
        - `is_direct_tri_match` true: the chemical is itself on the TRI list; no surrogate is
          needed.
        - `resolution_method` "tri_category_member": the chemical is not listed in TRI on its
          own but is a member of a TRI category (`query_categories`: code and name). Tell the
          user it was matched through that category, never as itself a listed chemical. TRI
          reports category releases under the category code for all members together, so look
          up releases with that code and say they are not releases of this chemical alone. No
          similarity is involved and no surrogate is returned; the chemical's own toxicity
          benchmark is still needed.
        - Otherwise, report `hybrid_read_across_score` and `within_applicability_domain` with
          anything you take from the surrogate. A surrogate's benchmark is a read-across
          estimate, not a measured value for the query chemical; say so.
        - `within_applicability_domain` false: the surrogate is too dissimilar. Do not use its
          values, or if you show them, say plainly that they are outside the applicability
          domain.
        - A null surrogate means none could be found; report that, do not guess one.

    Args:
        cas_number: CAS registry number as the user gave it, e.g. "107-83-5" (hyphens
            optional). Never a number recalled from a chemical's name: if the user gave only
            a name, ask for the CAS number instead of calling this tool.
        require_toxicity_benchmarks: True to consider only TRI chemicals known to have an
            IRIS benchmark (ignored, with a warning, if that is not known).
        sector_naics_prefix: Optional NAICS code prefix (e.g. "325") to consider only TRI
            chemicals reported by that industry (ignored, with a warning, if unknown or if
            no chemical matches).

    Returns:
        A dict with:
        - query_cas, query_smiles, query_mw: the query chemical (MW in g/mol)
        - is_direct_tri_match: the query chemical is itself on the TRI list
        - surrogate_tri_cas, surrogate_name, surrogate_smiles, surrogate_mw: the closest
          TRI chemical (MW in g/mol); null if none could be found
        - moldeberta_cosine_sim: embedding similarity, -1 to 1
        - morgan_tanimoto_sim: shared structural fragments, 0 to 1
        - hybrid_read_across_score: the combined score the choice is based on, 1 = identical
        - mw_scaling_factor: query_mw / surrogate_mw. It is reported, never applied: a
          surrogate benchmark in mg/m^3 can be put on a molar basis by multiplying it by
          this factor; say so if you do. Null if a molecular weight is missing
        - within_applicability_domain: whether the score reaches the configured threshold
        - query_categories: TRI categories (code, name) that list the query chemical; empty
          unless it is a category member
        - surrogate_category: the category (code, name) TRI reports the surrogate under, or
          null if TRI lists the surrogate on its own
        - resolution_method: "direct_tri_catalog_match", "tri_category_member",
          "hybrid_read_across" or "unresolved"
        - warnings: why a value is null, filters not applied, or that the surrogate is
