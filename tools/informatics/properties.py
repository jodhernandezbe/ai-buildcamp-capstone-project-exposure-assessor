def fetch_chemical_properties(cas_number: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> ChemicalProperties:
    """Fetch physical-chemical properties and toxicity values for a chemical.

    Purpose:
        Use this to learn what a chemical is and how hazardous it is to breathe or ingest:
        its toxicity benchmarks (`rfc`, `iur`) are what an exposure result is judged
        against, so without them a concentration can be computed but not interpreted. A
        benchmark that comes back null means no usable value exists in the source; the
        matching risk cannot be computed and that must be reported, not replaced by a
        guess. Every value is converted to the fixed unit listed below, so results can be
        used directly (pass `rfc` and `iur` to `calculate_exposure_metrics` as they are).
        `preferred_name` is the only name to call the chemical by; when it is null, refer
        to the chemical by its CAS number alone and never supply a name for it.

    Args:
        cas_number: CAS registry number as the user gave it, e.g. "71-43-2" for benzene
            (hyphens optional). Never a number recalled from a chemical's name: if the user
            gave only a name, ask for the CAS number instead of calling this tool.

    Returns:
        A dict with:
        - preferred_name: the name CompTox calls the chemical by (null when CompTox gave
          none: then the chemical is referred to by its CAS number only)
        - molecular_weight: g/mol (average mass)
        - vapor_pressure: mmHg, as reported by the source (typically at 25 C)
        - density: g/cm^3
        - rfd: oral reference dose, mg/(kg*day) (non-cancer benchmark for ingestion)
        - rfc: inhalation reference concentration, mg/m^3 (non-cancer benchmark)
        - sf: oral cancer slope factor, (mg/(kg*day))^-1
        - iur: inhalation unit risk, (ug/m^3)^-1 (cancer potency)
        - sources: for each value found, "CompTox" (name and molecular weight),
          "experimental" or "predicted" (properties), or the toxicity database name
        - toxicity_details: for each of rfd, rfc, sf and iur that has a value:
          source (database), exposure_route (the route the value applies to: "oral" for
          rfd and sf, "inhalation" for rfc and iur), route_reported (the route as the
          source recorded it, "not specified" if it gave none), endpoint (the critical
          effect or cancer endpoint, e.g. "leukemia"; null if the source gave none) and
          assessment ("cancer" or "non-cancer")
        - warnings: one message per value that is None

        When you report a toxicity value, say which exposure route it applies to, its
        source and its endpoint from `toxicity_details`.

        Toxicity values come from the highest-priority database that has them (IRIS
        first). When that database lists several values, the most conservative is
        returned: the lowest RfD or RfC, the highest slope factor or unit risk.

        Any value is None when it was not found, its reported unit could not be
        converted safely, or it was not a positive number; check `warnings` and tell
        the user rather than guessing.
