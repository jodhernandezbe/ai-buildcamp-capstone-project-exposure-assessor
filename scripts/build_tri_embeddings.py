"""Build the read-across catalog from the current TRI chemical list.

Reads the TRI chemical list from Envirofacts (``tri_chem_info``), keeps the discrete chemicals
still listed (a TRI group such as N420 has no single structure), and writes each one's
canonical SMILES, molecular weight, MolDeBERTa embedding and ECFP4 bits to the catalog. The
existing catalog is the structure cache: a chemical already in it keeps its SMILES, and only
newly listed chemicals are looked up on PubChem. Embeddings and bits are recomputed for every
row, so a model or fingerprint change never leaves stale vectors; the pinned model re-embeds a
given SMILES to the identical bytes, so an unchanged chemical rewrites to an identical shard.

The catalog is written as one shard per leading CAS digit, so each committed file stays small.
Shards are staged beside their targets and renamed together, so a failed build leaves the
committed catalog as it was.

The organic members of the TRI categories (``[tri_categories]``) are added as further
candidates, marked as coming from a category and carrying their category codes; inorganic
members are left out because the structure encoder is not meaningful for metals and salts, and
a member that is a discrete TRI chemical stays a TRI-list row.

Usage: ``uv run python -m scripts.build_tri_embeddings [--directory PATH]``
Default output: ``[read_across].directory``.
