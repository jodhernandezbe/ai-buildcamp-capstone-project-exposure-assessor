# agent-evaluation Specification

## Purpose

Behavioral evaluation of the exposure-assessor agent: runs the real agent with an OpenAI chat
model on scripted scenarios and checks which tools it calls, with what arguments, and what its
final report says, so regressions in prompts or tool descriptions are caught.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scenario runs are captured as records
The evaluation SHALL run the production agent graph (the registered tools with their real
names, descriptions and argument schemas, and the production system prompt) once per scenario
and SHALL capture each run as one record holding: the scenario id, the user query, every tool
call in order with its name and arguments, every tool output, the final report text, and
whether the run completed or the error that ended it. A run that ends in an error SHALL still
produce a record.

#### Scenario: Completed run
- **WHEN** a scenario is run and the agent finishes with a final answer
- **THEN** its record lists the tool calls in the order made, their outputs and the final report, and is marked completed

#### Scenario: Run ends in an error
- **WHEN** the agent run raises (for example it exceeds the step limit)
- **THEN** the record is marked not completed with the error message and the scenario fails

### Requirement: The agent under test uses the program's chat model
The agent under test SHALL be driven by the same chat model the program runs: the one
configured in the agent settings (provider, model, API-key variable, timeout and step limit),
built by the program's own chat model factory. The evaluation SHALL NOT name or construct an
agent model of its own. The judge model SHALL come from the evaluation settings. When an API key
is not set, evaluation runs SHALL be skipped with a message naming the variable, not fail.

#### Scenario: Model swapped in settings
- **WHEN** the agent model name is edited in the settings
- **THEN** the program and the next evaluation run both use that model

#### Scenario: Missing key
- **WHEN** the OpenAI key variable is unset or empty
- **THEN** the evaluation tests are skipped and say which variable is missing

### Requirement: Tool outputs are recorded from live services and replayed
Tools that call network services SHALL be replayed from recordings made by running those tools
against the live services; recordings SHALL NOT be written by hand. Tools that need no network
(the exposure calculation) SHALL run for real during replay. A replayed tool SHALL return the
recorded output for a call whose arguments match a recording. A call with no matching recording
SHALL fail closed: the tool returns an error result to the agent saying no recording exists, and
the record marks the call as unrecorded so the scenario fails with a message to re-record. A
recording mode SHALL run the scenario with the live tools and save every network tool output.

#### Scenario: Recorded call
- **WHEN** the agent calls a network tool with arguments that match a recording
- **THEN** it receives the recorded output and no network request is made

#### Scenario: Unrecorded call
- **WHEN** the agent calls a network tool with arguments that have no recording
- **THEN** the tool returns an error result, the call is marked unrecorded and the scenario fails naming the call

#### Scenario: Offline tool
- **WHEN** the agent calls the exposure calculation during replay
- **THEN** the real calculation runs on the arguments the agent passed

#### Scenario: Recording
- **WHEN** a scenario is run in recording mode
- **THEN** each network tool output is saved so a later replay reproduces it

### Requirement: Deterministic checks score tool use and completion
Each scenario SHALL declare deterministic checks evaluated on its record by the evaluation
framework, each yielding pass or fail with a reason: which tools must, must not, or may be
called; how many times a tool is called relative to the tool outputs (for example once per
assessed facility); which arguments a call must carry (for example the CAS number asked for, or
every stack candidate a facility's stack result returned); call order where it matters; that no
call was unrecorded; and that the run completed. Checks SHALL compare against values found in
the record's tool outputs, never against numbers written into the check.

#### Scenario: Forbidden tool called
- **WHEN** a scenario forbids a tool and the record contains a call to it
- **THEN** that check fails and names the call

#### Scenario: Count tied to tool output
- **WHEN** a check requires one exposure calculation per assessed facility
- **THEN** the expected facilities are taken from the stack requests in the record, and a different number of exposure calls for a facility fails

#### Scenario: Arguments tied to tool output
- **WHEN** a check requires the exposure calculation to carry every NEI candidate of a facility
- **THEN** the expected candidates are taken from the stack result in the record, and a call missing any of them fails

### Requirement: LLM judges score report qualities
Report qualities that code cannot verify SHALL be scored by an OpenAI judge model named in the
evaluation settings. Each judge SHALL answer one narrow pass/fail criterion about the final
report, given the report and, where needed, the tool outputs, and SHALL record its reasoning.
A judge that cannot be reached SHALL make its check fail, not pass.

#### Scenario: Criterion met
- **WHEN** the final report satisfies a judge criterion
- **THEN** the judge check passes and its reasoning is kept in the results

#### Scenario: Judge unavailable
- **WHEN** the judge call fails
- **THEN** the check fails with the error as its reason

### Requirement: Each evaluation run writes a report
Each evaluation run SHALL write a human-readable report per scenario, showing every check and
judge with its result and reason and an overall pass/fail, into a folder for that run under a
configured directory that is not committed.

#### Scenario: Report written
- **WHEN** an evaluation run finishes
- **THEN** the run's folder holds one report per scenario run, with one entry per check and judge

### Requirement: Evaluations are opt-in
Evaluation tests SHALL be marked so they are excluded from the default test run and from the
pre-commit hooks, and SHALL run when the marker is selected explicitly.

#### Scenario: Default test run
- **WHEN** the default test command runs
- **THEN** no evaluation test runs and no model is called

#### Scenario: Explicit selection
- **WHEN** the evaluation marker is selected
- **THEN** the evaluation tests run

### Requirement: Scenario catalogue
The evaluation SHALL keep a catalogue of scenarios, each with an id, the user query, its
recordings and its checks. A scenario that depends on behavior not yet implemented SHALL be
listed as blocked with the reason and SHALL NOT be run. The catalogue SHALL cover: happy paths,
tool use and fallback order, edge cases, and failure modes.

#### Scenario: Blocked scenario
- **WHEN** the catalogue lists a scenario as blocked
- **THEN** it is reported as skipped with its reason

### Requirement: Chemical given by name only
The catalogue SHALL include a scenario in which the user names a chemical by its common name
(formaldehyde) and gives no CAS number. It SHALL pass only when: the run completed; no tool was
called; the final report states no CAS number; and an LLM judge confirms the reply asks the user
for the CAS registry number and presents no facility, concentration or risk result.

#### Scenario: CAS filled in from memory
- **WHEN** the agent calls a tool with a CAS number it supplied itself
- **THEN** the no-tool-call check fails and names the call

#### Scenario: Reply does not ask for the CAS number
- **WHEN** the final reply does not ask for the CAS number
- **THEN** the LLM judge check fails with the judge's reasoning

### Requirement: Full assessment of a facility with its own stacks
The catalogue SHALL include a scenario asking for an assessment of a chemical given by CAS number
whose recorded inventory returns facilities that have NEI stack candidates. It SHALL pass only
when: the run completed with no unrecorded call; the chemical's properties and the emissions
inventory were requested with the CAS number asked for; every facility the agent assessed had
its NEI stacks requested with its `frs_id`, its weather and its population requested with that
facility's coordinates; the exposure calculation ran exactly once per assessed facility, carrying
every NEI stack candidate of that facility and its emission rate; the industry, SCC process and
SCC stack tools were not called for a facility that had NEI candidates; and a judge confirms the
report gives a summary, a per-facility table with units showing the range over stacks and both
the worst and the representative case, the source of each input, and a limitations section.

#### Scenario: One stack evaluated out of several
- **WHEN** a facility has several NEI candidates and the exposure call for it carries only one
- **THEN** the candidate-coverage check fails naming the missing candidates

#### Scenario: Some candidates left out
- **WHEN** a facility has ten NEI candidates and the exposure call for it carries six
- **THEN** the candidate-coverage check fails naming the missing candidates

#### Scenario: One call per stack
- **WHEN** the agent runs the exposure calculation once per candidate instead of once per facility
- **THEN** the one-call-per-facility check fails

#### Scenario: Unneeded fallback
- **WHEN** a facility has NEI candidates and the agent also calls the SCC stack tool for it
- **THEN** the forbidden-tool check fails

#### Scenario: Complete assessment
- **WHEN** the agent follows the chain for every facility it assesses and writes the full report
- **THEN** every check passes

### Requirement: Cassette current with the tools
A scenario's cassette SHALL be recorded while every service it needs answers (a recording made during an outage carries the outage, not the data), and SHALL hold a recording for every call the agent can make on either route it may take (the batch assessment, or the chain by hand with the current tool signatures). A replay that hits an unrecorded call SHALL fail the scenario and be answered by re-recording it, never by editing the cassette.

#### Scenario: Tool signature changed
- **WHEN** a tool the agent calls gains an argument and the agent now passes it
- **THEN** the replay reports the call as unrecorded and the scenario is re-recorded

#### Scenario: Service outage during recording
- **WHEN** a service fails while a scenario is being recorded
- **THEN** the recording is not kept as the cassette

### Requirement: The report names each input's source
A scenario MAY declare a deterministic check that the final report names the source of each input the run obtained: for every weather, residents and properties result in the record, the distinctive part of its `source` text (for example "era5", "ACS", "CompTox", a benchmark source name) SHALL appear in the report, and the chemical SHALL be referred to by the name the properties result gave or by its CAS number, never by another name. The expected strings SHALL come from the record's tool outputs.

#### Scenario: Weather source paraphrased
- **WHEN** the weather result's source is "Open-Meteo era5 reanalysis 2024" and the report says only "local weather"
- **THEN** the check fails and names the missing source

#### Scenario: Invented chemical name
- **WHEN** the properties result has no name and the report calls the chemical by a name
- **THEN** the check fails
