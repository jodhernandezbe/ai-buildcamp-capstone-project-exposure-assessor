# app-configuration Specification

## Purpose

Keeps external-service URLs, endpoints and timing parameters in a configuration file
so they can change without editing code.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Externalized service settings
The system SHALL read the CompTox base URL, endpoint path templates (CAS search, chemical detail, property summary and ToxVal), request delay and request timeout from a configuration file, and SHALL NOT embed them in Python code. The configuration SHALL also name the CompTox API-key header and the environment variable holding the key, SHALL name where molecular weight is read from (response field, the unit the service reports it in, target unit), SHALL list the CompTox properties to extract (CompTox property name, result key, target unit), and SHALL list the CompTox toxicity values to extract (result key, accepted ToxVal type labels, accepted exposure routes, preference for the lowest or highest value, target unit) together with the ordered source-priority list used to choose among records. The configuration SHALL also hold a table of unit-spelling aliases used before unit conversion.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the CompTox settings
- **THEN** it returns the base URL, endpoint templates, delay and timeout from the file, plus the header name, key variable name, property list, toxicity value list and source-priority list for CompTox, with a target unit on every property and toxicity entry and routes and preference on every toxicity entry

#### Scenario: Changing the endpoint
- **WHEN** the URL in the configuration file is edited
- **THEN** subsequent lookups use the new URL with no code change

#### Scenario: Adding a property
- **WHEN** an entry is added to the CompTox property list
- **THEN** the loader returns it with no code change

#### Scenario: Adding a toxicity value
- **WHEN** an entry is added to the CompTox toxicity value list
- **THEN** the loader returns it with no code change

#### Scenario: Invalid toxicity entry
- **WHEN** a toxicity entry has no key, no accepted labels, no accepted routes, a preference other than "lowest" or "highest", or a duplicate key
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

#### Scenario: Molecular weight settings
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the CompTox settings
- **THEN** it returns the molecular weight response field, reported unit and target unit, and raises a `ValueError` naming the key if the table or any of its keys is missing

#### Scenario: Missing target unit
- **WHEN** a property or toxicity entry has no target unit
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

#### Scenario: CAS search path without placeholder
- **WHEN** the CAS search path does not contain the CAS placeholder
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the key

#### Scenario: Unit aliases loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the unit settings
- **THEN** it returns the alias table from the file, and a missing table yields no aliases

### Requirement: Validated, typed configuration
The system SHALL validate the configuration on load and expose it as typed objects.

#### Scenario: Missing or invalid value
- **WHEN** a required key is missing, or the delay or timeout is negative or non-numeric
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

#### Scenario: Missing file
- **WHEN** the configuration file does not exist
- **THEN** the loader raises `FileNotFoundError` naming the path

### Requirement: Overridable location
The system SHALL allow the configuration file path to be supplied explicitly, and
otherwise use the default file shipped in the repository.

#### Scenario: Explicit path
- **WHEN** a path is passed to the loader
- **THEN** that file is read instead of the default

### Requirement: Secrets kept out of configuration
The configuration file SHALL NOT contain API keys; it SHALL only name the environment variable that holds them.

#### Scenario: Key reference
- **WHEN** CompTox settings are loaded
- **THEN** they expose the environment variable name, not a key value

### Requirement: Externalized TRI settings
The system SHALL read the EPA Envirofacts TRI release-query path template, page size, maximum pages, and the list of environmental media to keep from the configuration file, and SHALL NOT embed them in Python code; the base URL, delay between requests, request timeout, maximum retries and retry backoff come from the shared `[efservice]` table. The configuration SHALL also name the TRI field names used for the kept records so a renamed column needs only a configuration change, and the list of states whose longitudes are east of Greenwich. The configuration SHALL also hold the operating hours per year used to turn an annual release into a rate (an `[emissions]` table, default 8,760), validated on load.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the TRI settings
- **THEN** it returns the path template, paging values and the media list from the file

#### Scenario: Changing the media
- **WHEN** a medium is added to or removed from the configured list
- **THEN** subsequent lookups use the new list with no code change

#### Scenario: Operating hours loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the emissions settings
- **THEN** it returns the operating hours per year from the file, and the unit alias table includes the TRI mass spelling "Pounds"

#### Scenario: Invalid operating hours
- **WHEN** the operating hours per year are missing, non-numeric, a boolean, zero, negative, or greater than 8,784
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the key

#### Scenario: Invalid value
- **WHEN** the page size or page cap is not a positive integer, the media list is empty, or the path lacks the CAS placeholder
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

### Requirement: Stack parameter settings
The configuration SHALL hold, for the stack-parameter tools: the PSTK file path, its SCC column, an optional FIPS column with the values that mark national rows, the column and source unit of each of the four stack quantities, the target unit of each quantity, the plausible range (minimum and maximum, in target units) for each quantity, and the AirToxScreen global fallback values (3.0 m, 0.2 m, 4.0 m/s, 295.4 K). The loader SHALL return these as an immutable typed object.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the stack settings
- **THEN** it returns the PSTK path, column mapping, source and target units, plausible ranges and fallback values

#### Scenario: Invalid stack settings
- **WHEN** a fallback value is not a positive finite number, a range has minimum not below maximum, a fallback lies outside its range, or a quantity is missing from any table
- **THEN** the loader raises an error naming the offending entry

#### Scenario: Unconvertible source unit
- **WHEN** a configured source unit cannot be converted to its target unit
- **THEN** an error naming the quantity is raised before any lookup result is returned

### Requirement: SCC index settings
The configuration SHALL hold, for the SCC retrieval tool: the source table path, its column names, the persisted index directory, the collection name, the data categories and statuses to index, the number of results to return and the indexing batch size. It SHALL separately hold the embedding settings: provider name, model name, API-key environment variable name and request timeout. The loaders SHALL return these as immutable typed objects.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loaders are asked for the SCC index and embedding settings
- **THEN** they return every listed value from the file

- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

### Requirement: Exposure settings
The system SHALL read from an `[exposure]` table, and SHALL NOT embed in Python code: the list of (stability class, 10 m wind speed) combinations of the screening meteorology; the distance array (segments of start, end and step, in meters, and the minimum distance); the receptor height; the factor from the 1-hour to the annual average; the wind-profile exponent and the potential temperature gradient of each stability class; the exposure time, frequency and duration, and the cancer averaging time; and, for each age band, the inhalation rate and body weight; each with the source it comes from in a comment.

- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

### Requirement: Recent TRI years setting
The `[tri]` table SHALL define `recent_years` (a positive integer), `publication_lag_years` (a non-negative integer: TRI for year N is released by June of N + 1), `max_listed` (a positive integer, the most facilities the inventory tool lists to the model) and a `{after_year}` placeholder in the release path; the window ends with the current year minus `publication_lag_years`. The loader SHALL reject a missing, non-integer, boolean or out-of-range value and a path without the placeholder.

#### Scenario: Window years
- **WHEN** `recent_years` is 2, `publication_lag_years` is 1 and the current year is 2026

- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the key

### Requirement: Agent chat model settings
The system SHALL read from an `[agent]` table the chat model that drives the agent: the
provider, the model name, the name of the environment variable holding the provider API key
(never the key itself), the request timeout, the step limit of one agent run and the sampling
temperature, validated on load, and SHALL NOT embed them in Python code. The shipped
temperature SHALL be 0, so a screening assessment is as reproducible as the provider allows.
The program, the web program and the agent evaluation SHALL all build the agent's chat model
from this table through one factory, so they always run the same model with the same
temperature. The factory SHALL accept the API key either injected as a secret value (from the
OS credential store) or read from the named environment variable when none is injected.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded

- **THEN** the model is built with the injected key and the environment is not read

#### Scenario: Missing key
- **WHEN** no key is injected and the API-key variable is unset or blank and the chat model is built
- **THEN** building raises an error naming the variable

#### Scenario: Invalid entry
- **WHEN** a key is missing, the model name is empty, the provider is not supported, the timeout is not a positive number or is a boolean, the step limit is not a positive integer, or the temperature is missing, a boolean, or outside 0 to 2
- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

### Requirement: Evaluation settings
The system SHALL read from an `[evaluation]` table: the judge model provider and name, the name
of the environment variable holding the judge provider's API key (never the key itself), the
names of the tools that run for real during replay (they need no network), the directory of
recorded tool outputs and the directory reports are written to, validated on load, and SHALL NOT
embed them in Python code. The agent's own model SHALL NOT be configured here.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the evaluation settings
- **THEN** it returns the values from the file, with relative directories resolved against the project root

#### Scenario: Changing the judge
- **WHEN** the judge model name is edited
- **THEN** subsequent evaluation runs use it with no code change

#### Scenario: Key variable name only
- **WHEN** the settings are read
- **THEN** they expose the environment variable name, not a key value

- the fingerprint radius and bit count, and the embedding width;
- alpha, the applicability-domain threshold (calibrated against the catalog's leave-one-out
  score distribution, with that calibration recorded beside the value) and the catalog's column
  names;
- the catalog's shard directory, its shard file-name template (containing `{prefix}`) and the
  number of leading CAS digits that name a shard;
- the Envirofacts `tri_chem_info` path, containing `{start}` and `{end}`, and its page size;
- the CAS, name and inactive-date field names, the inactive-date value meaning "still listed", and whether delisted chemicals are kept (default: no).

The base URL and request policy for `tri_chem_info` SHALL be the shared Envirofacts ones.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded
- **WHEN** the loader is asked for the read-across settings
- **THEN** it returns the values from the file, with alpha 0.55 and threshold 0.60 by default

#### Scenario: Invalid entry
- **WHEN** alpha or the threshold is outside [0, 1] or boolean, the URL lacks `{cas}`, the `tri_chem_info` path lacks `{start}` or `{end}`, the shard template lacks `{prefix}`, the prefix length or the timeout, page size or a width or radius is not positive, or a column name is empty

  non-negative integer; zero turns the completion check off);
- the step label per tool name;
- the light and dark basemap style URLs, the initial map view (the bounds of the contiguous
  United States), the downwind sector half-angle (degrees), the marker size scale for emission
  rate, and the coordinate tolerance for matching receptors to facilities;
- the HQ threshold of concern and the lower bound of the "near" band, and the cancer-risk
  thresholds, each with a comment naming its basis;
- the suggestion chip texts, the significant digits for metrics, and the narrow-viewport
  breakpoint;
- the workspace layout limits: the collapsed rail width (px), the expanded rail's default,
  minimum and maximum width (px), the chat dock's default share of the viewport, its minimum
  width (px) and maximum share of the viewport, and the overview panel's default, minimum and
  maximum share of the analysis area;
- the maximum number of conversation threads held in memory;
- per-model token prices (USD per million input, cached input and output tokens) with the date
  and source they were taken from.
The frontend SHALL receive the display and layout settings it needs from an API endpoint, never
by duplicating them.

#### Scenario: Settings loaded

- **THEN** the loader raises a `ValueError` naming the offending key

#### Scenario: Completion check off
- **WHEN** `max_nudges` is 0
- **THEN** the program builds the agent without the completion check

#### Scenario: Frontend reads display settings
- **WHEN** the frontend starts
- **THEN** it fetches thresholds, map styles, the initial view, layout limits, chips and digits from the API instead of hard-coding them

### Requirement: Assessment settings
