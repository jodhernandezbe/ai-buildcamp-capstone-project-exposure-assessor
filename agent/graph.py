    Args:
        model: Any LangChain chat model that supports tool calling. Constructed
            by the caller so the provider can be swapped without touching this module.
        tools: Tools to bind. Defaults to everything in the tool registry.
        system_prompt: System prompt text. Defaults to ``prompts/agent_system.md``.
        checkpointer: Keeps each thread's history between invocations (pass a ``thread_id``
            in the run config). None, the default, keeps no history between calls.
        scope_guard: When given, every user turn is first classified by ``model`` and an
            off-topic one is answered with a redirect without running the agent or its tools.
            None, the default, leaves the graph exactly as without the check.
        completion_guard: When given, every answer is reviewed by ``model`` and one that only
            announces the work it will do next sends the agent back to work (a bounded number
            of times). None, the default, leaves the graph exactly as without the check.

        A compiled graph; invoke it with ``{"messages": [...]}``.
