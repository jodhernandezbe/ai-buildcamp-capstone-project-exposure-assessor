"""Completion guardrail: a model-based check, after the agent answers, that it did not stop early.

An opt-in node of the agent graph. A model that ends its turn by announcing the work it will
do next ("I will now gather the stack data…") leaves the assessment undone. The injected chat
model judges the final reply against the user's request; a reply that defers the copilot's own
work gets a nudge and the agent runs again, at most a few times per turn. The nudge is a named
user message, so the interface and the scope check can leave it out of what they show and judge.
The module never imports a provider package; the model is injected.
