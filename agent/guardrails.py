"""Scope guardrail: a model-based check, before the tool-bound agent, that a request is on topic.

An opt-in node of the agent graph. The injected chat model classifies the latest user turn,
judged in the light of a short window of the conversation, as in or out of scope. Off-topic turns
get a short, warm redirect and end there: the tool-bound model is not called and no tool runs.
The module never imports a provider package; the model is injected.
