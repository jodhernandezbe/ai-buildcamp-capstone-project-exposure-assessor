        max_refined: Safety bound on the facilities given their own stacks and worst case in one
            call. Every facility reaching a threshold is refined; only the excess over this bound
            is left unassessed, and that is reported.
        max_workers: Facilities processed at the same time (each makes its own requests).
        scc_min_score: Lowest similarity (0-1) of an SCC match to the facility's industry for
            its PSTK stack to be used; below it the EPA global default stack is used.
        max_scc_stacks: Most distinct PSTK stacks used for one facility (evaluated as a range).
        inventory_cache_seconds: How long the inventory of a chemical (and place) is reused, so
            listing the facilities and then assessing them reads TRI once.
        max_worst_case_listed: Most worst-case-only facilities listed to the model (the rest
            are counted).
        max_screened_out_listed: Most screened-out facilities listed to the model, the closest
            to a threshold first (so a report has a table even when all were screened out).
        weather_cell_deg: Grid cell of the weather reanalysis (degrees); facilities in one
            cell share one weather request.
        screening: The thresholds and temperatures of the screen.
