# commons/ rules

Project-wide guidance is in the root `CLAUDE.md`; these rules apply to work in `commons/`.

- `commons/` must not import any other project package, read `config/`, do I/O, or call an
  LLM. Functions are pure; anything configurable (e.g. unit aliases) is a parameter.
- Add a module here only when it is generic and used (or clearly about to be used) by more
  than one layer; otherwise keep it with its caller.
